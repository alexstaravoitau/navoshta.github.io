Hey – I'm Alex Staravoitau, a software engineer with a surname you're gonna struggle to pronounce. I make apps for iOS and iPadOS, although I used to work on a lot of different things over the years, as evident from my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/{{ author.github }}){:target="_blank"}. I dedicate most of my time to [Juno](https://juno.sh){:target="_blank"} and [Tinkerstellar](https://tinkerstellar.com){:target="_blank"} apps these days.

If you have any questions — feel free to reach out!
