Hey – I'm Alex Staravoitau, a software engineer with a surname you're gonna struggle to pronounce. I mainly make iOS apps these days, although I'm also highly keen on data science and machine learning, and this complicated hobby is taking most of my spare time. Not to mention I'm a huge fan of astrophysics, music and good design.
