[CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/){:target="_blank"} is a web-based cloud computing and course management platform for computational mathematics based on Jupyter. I was lucky to have them as Juno Connect launch partner, since for a truly seamless Jupyter experience Juno Connect needed a cloud computing service integration that would let you start coding right out of the box.
